Evaluating BC Provincial Academic Detailing Service’s intervention on antibiotic prescribing for suspected urinary tract infections in British Columbia’s nursing homes

To provide a more transparent analysis of the BC Provincial Academic Detailing Service's intervention in nursing homes, the analytic code is available for review. The impact evaluation is done for a thesis at the UBC School of Population and Public Health. There is no raw data available with the code. 

The final version of the thesis is available at https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0378708?o=0
